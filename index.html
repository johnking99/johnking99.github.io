    <div class="about">
        <p>I am a goal focused and success driven senior MIS student with a proven ability to succeed in multiple work and academic environments. I have demonstrated ability to analyze and solve problems, work collaboratively and meet fast-paced organizational deadlines. I am highly organized and detail oriented with a passion for leadership. </p>
        <p>Key skills: SQL, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, VBA, teamwork, organization, data analysis, cybersecurity</p>
        <p>I am currently employed as a Cybersecurity Intern at Chickasaw Nation Industries. In this position, I analyze system reports to capture and mitigate vulnerabilities from cyber-attacks. I am also developing a system security plan to meet CMMC level 3 security qualifications. One of my key roles is to identify vulnerabilities within services and mitigate these vulnerabilities by analyzing logs, events, and investigating alerts.</p>
        <p>I have accepted a full-time position at BOK Financial in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I will be working closely with their IT department in their ACT Training Program.</p>
        <p>In previous employment, I had the opportunity to work on the Communications Team at Gibbs College of Architecture at the University of Oklahoma. I gained valuable experience in web development, website management, professional writing, and data analytics. One of my accomplishments as an intern was conducting an enrollment data analysis which outlined the fluctuation in enrollment compared to external factors.</p>
        <p>I work diligently while pursing my academic, professional, and extracurricular activities. In my leadership outside the workforce, I served on the executive team as Chief Information Officer in my Integrated Business Core Practicum course at the University of Oklahoma. I worked alongside a team of 16 other students in creating a professional business, marketing and selling a product, and donating time and monetary earnings to charity.</p>
